# 🦀 Carcinize 🦀

Born to write rust but forced to use python to survive?
Learned rust for fun and now all the missing language features are driving you crazy?
Want to look really p̶r̶e̶t̶e̶n̶t̶i̶o̶u̶s̶ cool in front of your coworkers?

Try Carcinization! 🦀 🦀 🦀

## Installation

Install with uv:

```bash
uv add carcinize
```

No I won't add examples for using `pip`, `poetry`, or god forbid `conda`. It's 2026, grow up and use `uv` you degenerate.

## Usage

```bash
carcinize
```
